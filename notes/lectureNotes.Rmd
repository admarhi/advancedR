#### General 
Good code should always be easy to check and reproduce.

#### Vectorization in R
Vectorization makes operations simpler, and code more readable. In addition, it is a simple method to store data and allows to manipulate and/or analyse it.

#### Using && or || instead of & or |
When using & or | we expect vectors (several values in c()). When using && or || however, we expect scalar (single) values. Therefore, the usage of the operators depends on the desired outcome. 

#### if statements in R

```r
a <- 3
b <- 8
````

```r
if (is.numeric(a) & is.numeric(b)) {
  sum(a,b)
} else if (is.character(a) & is.character(b)){
  paste(a, b)
} else {
  "error"
}
````

#### nested ifelse
```r
df <- data.frame(team = c('A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'C', 'D'),
                 points = c(4, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 12),
                 rebounds = c(3, 3, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7))


df$rating <- ifelse(df$points > 7, 'great', 
                    ifelse(df$points > 5, 'ok', 'bad')
                    
````

#### seq_along
Instead of:
```r
for(i in 1:length(wek)) {
  print(wek[i])
}
````
we can use seq_along to iterate along the vector, as it is more elegant and more robust.
```r
for(i in seq_along(wek)) {
  print(wek[i])

1:length(c())
seq_along(c())
````
